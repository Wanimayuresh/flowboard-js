# flowboard-js

## Overview
FlowBoard is a Kanban-style task management application built using
pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The purpose of this project is not UI polish alone, but to deeply
understand JavaScript fundamentals, browser behavior, performance
optimization, and scalable frontend architecture.

## Why Vanilla JavaScript?
This project intentionally avoids frameworks to:
- Master JavaScript internals
- Understand state-driven UI
- Learn event systems and browser APIs
- Build scalable frontend architecture from scratch

## Core Learning Goals
- State management without libraries
- Immutability and predictable updates
- Event delegation and performance optimization
- Drag & Drop API
- Modular architecture and design patterns

- ## Project Status
🚧 Planning & Architecture Phase

## Initial Feature Scope (MVP)

- Three default columns: Todo, In Progress, Done
- Create, delete, and move tasks
- Drag & drop between columns
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- State-driven rendering (no DOM-based state)
